#In this project we will analyze the ToothGrowth data
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)

#This datasets consists of 60 observations and three variables. Variables are
#len (numeric: tooth length increase),
#supp (categorical: VC or OJ) and
#dose (numerical: dose level - 0.5mg, 1mg or 2mg)
summary(ToothGrowth)
table(ToothGrowth$supp, as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose))
#We will plot boxplots for each suppliment type (red are OJ, blue are VC)
#and dosage vs tooth length increase
boxplot(len~supp*dose, data = ToothGrowth, col = c("red", "blue"),
        main = "Tooth Growth", xlab ="Suppliment type and dose mg",
        ylab = "tooth length increase in mm")

#We can see that as dosage increases, tooth length also increases
#We will prove this for dosages 1.0mg vs 2.0mg which is not obvious
ToothGrowth.dose1.0= subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 1)
ToothGrowth.dose2.0= subset(ToothGrowth, dose == 2)
doseEffect1.0_to_2.0  <- t.test( ToothGrowth.dose2.0$len,ToothGrowth.dose1.0$len)
doseEffect1.0_to_2.0$conf.int
#95% C.I. of the difference in tooth-length means between observations
#that received 1.0mg and 2.0mg dosage does not contain 0.
#We reject the null hypothesis that the true difference in means is zero.

#Now lets compare the tooth length increase between different suppliment types.
ToothGrowth.typeOJ = subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "OJ")
ToothGrowth.typeVC = subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "VC")
typeEffect <- t.test(ToothGrowth.typeOJ$len, ToothGrowth.typeVC$len)
typeEffect$conf.int
typeEffect$p.value
#The 95% c.i. of the difference in mean tooth length increase between observations of
#supp type OJ and supp type VC does contain 0. We fail to reject the
#null hypothesis that states the difference in means is zero.
#However p-value is only 6%. We will perform more tests. From the boxplots we can see that
#the means for 2.0mg between the two supp types looks the same. We will perform different tests
#for 2mg dosage and less than 2.0mg dosage
ToothGrowth.typeOJ.doselt2.0 = subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "OJ" & dose<2.0)
ToothGrowth.typeOJ.doseeq2.0 = subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "OJ" & dose==2.0)
ToothGrowth.typeVC.doselt2.0 = subset(ToothGrowth, supp == "VC" & dose<2.0)

typeEffect_eq2.0<- t.test(ToothGrowth.typeOJ.doseeq2.0$len, ToothGrowth.typeVC.doseeq2.0$len)
#For the tests below:
#Null Hypothesis: True difference in means is equal to 0
#Alternative hypothesis: True difference in means is not equal to 0
#Significance level: 5%

typeEffect_lt2.0$conf.int

#95% C.I. does not contain zero. We reject the null hypothesis and conculde there is a 
#difference in tooth length increase between types when dosage is less than 2.0mg

typeEffect_eq2.0$conf.int

#95% C.I. does  contain zero. We fail to reject the null hypothesis
